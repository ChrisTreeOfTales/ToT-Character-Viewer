# ToT Character Viewer - Development Plan

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Vision

A minimalistic, lightweight D&D character sheet application specifically designed for:
- **Homebrew classes** - Full customization support
- **Valdas Spire of Secrets content** - Investigator/Detective class
- **Local-first** - All data stored in SQLite, no internet required
- **Fast & responsive** - Built with modern web tech (React 19, Tailwind CSS 4)
- **Desktop native** - Tauri 2.0 for small bundle size and native performance

---

## ðŸŽ¨ UI/UX Design Principles

### Color Scheme
- **Dark theme** - Slate 900/800/700 backgrounds
- **Accent colors** - Blue for primary actions, Red for HP, Yellow/Purple for features
- **Minimalist** - Clean, distraction-free interface

### Layout
- **Sidebar** (left) - Character list with quick switching
- **Main area** (right) - Character sheet with all details
- **Responsive grid** - Flexbox/Grid for adaptive layouts

### Components Philosophy
- **Atomic design** - Small, reusable components
- **Accessibility** - Proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation
- **Performance** - Lazy loading, memoization where needed
- **Simplicity** - Keep code simple and well-commented for non-developers

## ðŸ”„ Data Flow

### Character Loading
1. App starts â†’ `initDatabase()` creates/opens SQLite DB
2. `loadCharacters()` fetches all characters with associated data
3. Characters displayed in sidebar
4. UI updates via React state

### Character Updates
1. User edits character â†’ Direct database update
2. SQLite updated via Tauri SQL plugin
3. Local state refreshed
4. UI auto-updates via React re-render

### Custom Content
- All custom skills/features/items marked with `isCustom: true`
- Can be edited/deleted unlike base D&D content
- Source field tracks origin (e.g., "Valdas Spire of Secrets", "Homebrew")
